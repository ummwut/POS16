A 16-bit Virtual Machine, Version 5. Intended as a Kerbal Space Program Plugin.

Starting up again on constructing an onboard computer for Kerbal Space Program, because why not?

It will have hardware support, which can include code for interfacing with the game (meaning a mockup human interface), or for peripheral functions. Suggested peripherals would be a floating-point processor, fly-by-wire interface, tetris, basically anything other plugins can do.
