Starting up again on constructing an onboard computer for Kerbal Space Program, because why not?

It will have hardware support, which can include code for interfacing with the game (meaning a mockup human interface), or for peripheral functions (like a floating point processor, or simply some code that can do signed and unsigned multiply and divide).
